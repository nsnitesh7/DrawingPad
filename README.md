The program assumes that the connection is done through the localhost, so to run the program it is necessary first to run the class Servidor to initialize the server, and then run the class Cliente, initializing the paint application (client). To view the functioning of the program it is necessary to open to client (Cliente class) at least twice. Then any drawing made in one of the blank area in one of the clients, will automatically be drawn in the other clients.

To run the application from different computers connected through a private network, it is necessary to change the first parameter on the new Socket() call, at line 38 of the Conexao.java file, with the new server address.
